# Philosophie g&#233;n&#233;rale de conception des classes
[!INCLUDE[vs2017banner](../assembler/inline/includes/vs2017banner.md)]

Microsoft Windows was designed long before the C\+\+ language became popular.  Because thousands of applications use the C\-language Windows application programming interface \(API\), that interface will be maintained for the foreseeable future.  Any C\+\+ Windows interface must therefore be built on top of the procedural C\-language API.  This guarantees that C\+\+ applications will be able to coexist with C applications.  
  
 The Microsoft Foundation Class Library is an object\-oriented interface to Windows that meets the following design goals:  
  
-   Significant reduction in the effort to write an application for Windows.  
  
-   Execution speed comparable to that of the C\-language API.  
  
-   Minimum code size overhead.  
  
-   Ability to call any Windows C function directly.  
  
-   Easier conversion of existing C applications to C\+\+.  
  
-   Ability to leverage from the existing base of C\-language Windows programming experience.  
  
-   Easier use of the Windows API with C\+\+ than with C.  
  
-   Easier to use yet powerful abstractions of complicated features such as ActiveX controls, database support, printing, toolbars, and status bars.  
  
-   True Windows API for C\+\+ that effectively uses C\+\+ language features.
